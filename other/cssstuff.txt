- Typical CSS stuff is put inbetween style tags like so...
<html>
	<head>
		<style>
		...
		</style>
	</head>
	<body>
	...
	</body>
<html>
- Defining rule for every instance of an element goes like so
p {
	background-color:black;
}
makes every paragraph (shown as <p>) element have text with a black background
- Classes are defined as so...
.class {
	...
}
- And implemented as so...
<body class="class">
